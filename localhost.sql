/*
What fields should the API contain?

ID- Not null, primary key, non-auto-increment. Acts as Pokemon ID.
name - Varchar(30)?
ImageURL - nullable (if null, use unknown icon), URL from the github repo, later conditionally styled to hopefully fit our needs?
description - Varchar (500)
primary typing - Not null, Varchar(15). In frontend, put a selection form. Minimizes error, helps conditional styling.
secondary typing - nullable, -||-
height - NUMERIC(7,2) meters 6,2 works, so let's make it 7,2 in case they want to make some colossal big pokemon. 
weight - NUMERIC(7,2) kg
